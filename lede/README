Prepare build:

have client.crt client.key

  git clone https://git.openwrt.org/source.git build
  cp -r files build
  cp client.crt client.key build/files/etc/openvpn/keys

Set up build for Netgear WGT634U:

  cp config-stub-wgt634u build/.config

Set up build for Ubiquiti AirRouter:

  cp config-stub-airrouter build/.config

Build:

  cd build
  make defconfig
  time make -j2 BUILD_LOG=1 IGNORE_ERRORS=m V=s  # for 2 cores

built images are in bin/targets/ar71xx/generic/
For the Ubiquiti AirRouter, the images are bin/targets/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-airrouter-squashfs-*.bin
For the Netgear WGT634U, the images are bin/targets/brcm47xx/legacy/openwrt-brcm47xx-legacy-standard-squashfs.trx

Install to Ubiquiti AirRouter with OpenVPN or LEDE already installed:

  scp bin/targets/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-airrouter-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin root@192.168.1.1:/tmp
flash sysupgrade image
  ssh root@192.168.1.1
  sysupgrade -v -n /tmp/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-airrouter-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin
wait for router to reboot

Install to Ubiquiti AirRouter with factory install (caution, don't update with a factory image version 6 or later, or you will flash a locked bootloader):

$ tftp 192.168.1.20
tftp> mode binary
tftp> put XM-v5.5.2.build14175.bin flash_update
Sent 6736122 bytes in 9.4 seconds
tftp> quit
power cycle router

All routers:

change password on router
  ssh root:test@192.168.1.1
  passwd

edit /etc/config/network on router for address unique in local network e.g.
  config interface 'lan'
    ...
    option ipaddr '192.168.8.1'

reboot router

Notes:

sysupgrade firmware:
https://lede-project.org/docs/user-guide/sysupgrade.cli
https://lede-project.org/docs/guide-quick-start/sysupgrade.luci
factory firmware:
https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/airrouter

The sysupgrade image is used if openwrt or lede is already on the router. Otherwise the factory image is used.
Use the -n argument to erase any exisiting config.

Replace passwd step with copying shadow to build/files/etc/shadow
Replace ip address step with copying network to build/files/etc/config/network?

The wifi is disabled by default.  You can only ssh in from a LAN port.  The LAN network
is 192.168.1.0/24 by default.
